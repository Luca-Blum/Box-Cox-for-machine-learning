# Experiments

#  [2D Study](2d.py)

Experiments to study the behavior of the Box-Cox transformation on artificially generated 2D datasets. 
The plotting functionality might be unusable for bigger gridsearch. 

# [Case Studies](case_studies.py)

Experiments to evaluate the performance of [iterative optimization](../boxcox/optimization/iterative_optimization.py) 
on two real world datasets. Additionally, the method was tested on 2D subsets and compared with
[gridsearch](../boxcox/optimization/gridsearch2D.py) as a baseline.
